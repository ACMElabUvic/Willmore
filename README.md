### DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
**inputs**

This folder contains both summarized and raw data data products (e.g. raw camera trap data csv files) used to produce key products in the outputs folder. 
*Files in main folder*
1) WillmoreSummer_alldata.csv : this is a binded file of the individual timelapse files from each camera site during the SUMMER study. The individual camera site csv files were unavailable
2) WillmoreWinter_alldata.csv : this is a binded file of the individual timelapse files from each camera site during the WINTER study. The individual camera site csv files were unavailable
3) SUMMER WILLMORE BIODIVERSITY SITE LOCATIONS CORRECTED 2017 : this file contains the location of each camera site (UTMs)
4) WillmoreLandCoverAll.csv : this file contains natural landcover data for the proportion area of a circular buffer around each camera site. Grid codes keys from the original data extraction are provided in other/Wilmore_Griz_Land_Class_Key.jpeg
5) WillmoreNDVI2008.csv : this file contains mean NDVI for each camera site in 2008
6) WillmoreNDVI2012.csv : this file contains mean NDVI for each camera site in 2012
7) WillmoreTRI.csv : this file contains mean TRI for each camera site
8) WW_HumanFootprintCover_corrected.csv : human footpring cover for each camera site (details below)

**outputs**

This folder contains the four key data products needed to move forward with additional analyses; 1) the raw detections recorded from cameras (including blank images, nothing has been filtered), 2) a summary of independent detections of wildlife species at each camera site to the standard 30 minute threshold, 3) the GPS locations of individual camera sites, and 4) covariates associated with each camera site extracted across multiple radius buffers (details below)

**relevant literature**  
This folder provides pdf copies of previously published papers using the Willmore Wilderness remote camera dataset. The purpose of this folder is to provide background/information on previously published work using this dataset. Note that sample numbers may vary between individual manuscripts due to specifics of individual projects, as well as the multiple deployment designs within the Willmore dataset.

### **DETAILS ON OUTPUTS** 
### Data specific information for : [outputs/willmore_camop.csv]  

* **Number of variables/columns:** 5
* **Number of observations/rows:** 115 (one per camera site) 

**Variable List:**
* **site** : camera site ID
* **Easting** : camera site Easting location
* **Northing** : camera site Northing location
* **start_date** : first day of camera operation as recorded by a camera trigger (no timelapse function used)
* **end_date** : last day of camera operation as recorded by a camera trigger (no timelapse function used)

### Data specific information for : [outputs/willmore_detections_raw.csv]  

* **Number of variables/columns:** 3
* **Number of observations/rows:** 151140

**Variable List:**
* **site** : camera site ID
* **datetime** : the datetime (year-month-day hour:minute:second) of the first camera image of each independent detection. Multiple images may be taken during a detection event, and this data has been sliced to the first image for simplicity. Note there was an error in the raw data resulting in no "seconds" being recorded from the timelapse data, therefore all detections end at the top of the hour (e.g. 6:03:00 AM). This should be of little consequence, but is annoying. 
* **species** : the species in the independent detection. Note this still contains "Unknowns" and some blanks, so this will need to be filtered/cleaned before any analysis.

### Data specific information for : [outputs/willmore_30min_independent_detections.csv]  

* **Number of variables/columns:** 5
* **Number of observations/rows:** 19072 (one row for each independent detection of a species at each site) 

**Variable List:**
* **site** : camera site ID
* **datetime** : the datetime (year-month-day hour:minute:second) of the first camera image of each independent detection. Multiple images may be taken during a detection event, and this data has been sliced to the first image for simplicity. Note there was an error in the raw data resulting in no "seconds" being recorded from the timelapse data, therefore all detections end at the top of the hour (e.g. 6:03:00 AM). This should be of little consequence, but is annoying. 
* **species** : the species in the independent detection. Note this still contains "Unknowns" and will need to be filtered/cleaned before any analysis.
* **timediff** : the difference in time between subsequent independent detections (mins). Note this could be calculated using the datetime column between subsequent detections. NA's represent the first detection of a species at a given camera, as there can be no difference in time from this event to a previous event. 
* **Event.ID** : a unique identifier for a species' independent detection at a camera site. 

### Data specific information for : [outputs/willmore_covariates.csv]  

* **Number of variables/columns:** 38

*   **railways**: a summary feature of many railway types, see page 48 of other/HFI2010_Metadata.pdf)
*   **resevoirs** : a body of water created by excavation or the man made damming of a river or stream

*   **verge** : no clear description - RECOMMEND REMOVAL OR NOT USING
*   **wellsites** : no clear description, but given there are two feature classes for active and abandoned wellsites, this is likely a combination of the two.
*   **wind_gen_facilities** : Wind turbines, operational or former, visible on imagery. Digitized to represent original land disturbance from construction.
*   **dense_conifer** : dense conifer
*   **moderate_conifer** : moderate conifer cover
*   **open_conifer** : open conifer cover
*   **mixed** : likely mixed tree species cover
*   **broadleaf** : deciduous tree cover
*   **treed_wetland** : wetlands with a high amount of trees
*   **shrub** : shrubs
*   **herb** : not sure, herbs? maybe oregano? (being cheeky, I can't find anything on this)
